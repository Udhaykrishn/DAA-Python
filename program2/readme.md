# Binary Search Time Complexity Experiment

This Python script performs a Binary search on user-provided arrays, measures the time taken to complete the searches, and plots the results to visualize the time complexity of the Binary search algorithm.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed. Additionally, you need to install the `matplotlib` library for plotting the results. You can install it using pip:

```sh
pip install matplotlib
