# Linear Search Time Complexity Experiment

This Python script performs a linear search on user-provided arrays, measures the time taken to complete the searches, and plots the results to visualize the time complexity of the linear search algorithm.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed. Additionally, you need to install the `matplotlib` library for plotting the results. You can install it using pip:

```sh
pip install matplotlib

1. Output

    ```bash
    Enter the number of runs:3

    Enter the number of elements:5

    Enter the elements of the array:10 20 30 40 50

    Enter the key element to be searched: 30
